# How Software is Developed

By now, you're hopefully getting excited about learning to code. Let's start diving into the details and show you how professional developers write software.

The first thing we need to learn when it comes to programming is how to think of and use our computer a bit differently. It's time for you to start thinking of your computer as a tool for creation. We're used to using our computer as a means for consumption: to browse the internet, check out some cute cat pics, browse Facebook, check your email. But as a programmer, our computer is our tool, it's how we create new things, what we use to build and practice our craft, to earn a living. So we're going to use it a bit differently.

See, all these graphics, all the beautiful visual and stunning effects you experience on your computer, they are just the tip of the iceberg. They are the frontend, the end-user-interface, the outcome of what programmers have built and how people use software. But underneath this graphical user interface is your operating system, and that's where we, as software developers, live. Think of it as the difference between being the driver of a car, only knowing how to use a car, and being a mechanic, capable of looking under the hood and fixing things.

We're going to focus right now on introducing you to the three main tools you'll use as a software developer: 

1. A Terminal
2. A Text Editor
3. A Programming Language and Interpreter

Luckily, we've bundled all 3 of these into one tool, called an “integrated development environment” or the Learn IDE for short. We'll get into how to use the Learn IDE in the next lesson but first we'll review what the individual pieces are all about.

Let's start talking about the Terminal, also known as the shell.

Under the hood of your operating system, underneath all of the programs you use every day, is the shell. The shell is the programmer's workbench, and we live in it. The shell is our command line, the place from which we give our computer raw instructions and play with its machinery. The shell is the capital T Terminal to travel the world of software. Every application, every program, from Wikipedia, to Candy Crush, to Google, to Facebook, in fact the world wide web itself, all software is born here, from a shell just like this. I wonder what you'll build?

What we do from our shell includes running the programs we're building, navigating our file system, and executing system tasks, all things we're going to talk about a bit more later. The shell we're going to use is built into the Learn IDE.

The next thing we need to know about is called a text editor and it's basically exactly what it sounds like: a program to edit raw text. When we write code, it's really just text in a programming language that we save as a file. Think of it like Microsoft Word but instead of being used to write essays and letters, use it  to write code. So instead of spell check and other things that are useful when we're creating a document, our text editor is built to make writing code more pleasant, doing things like autocompleting common lines and allowing us to easily nest blocks of text.

The text editor built into the Learn IDE is based on an editor called Atom, which was made by the good people at GitHub. It is one of the most popular, extensible and powerful text editors ever created.

OK, now that we can write code in our editor and run system commands in our shell, the final piece of the puzzle is understanding how to execute or compile the code we write as we build programs.

At their lowest level, computers only understand binary machine code, expressed in 1s and 0s. Since we don't want to speak machine, we write instructions for computers in programming languages. A programming language is a set of rules for how to express instructions to a computer. This code is written in regular English characters. Whether, Ruby, or Javascript, or C#, all programming languages are just conventions for organizing the logic and data that defines what the program you're writing does. Programming languages make it easy for us to express ourselves but then the computer has to be able to interpret our written instructions and convert that code to the machine code it understands. The conversion process from a programming language to machine code is called "compiling" (also sometimes called executing or running or interpreting) and it is done through a program called an interpreter. Every programming language comes with an interpreter that you can use to “run” your programs, which means sending the code you've written to be converted and executed by the computer.

This is the programming process: write code in a programming language of your choosing using your favorite text editor, save the file, then execute your program by sending that file to the interpreter using your command line. 

It may still sound a little abstract, but soon enough you'll be practicing these steps with the help of the Learn IDE, and it will all quickly feel very natural!
